Enable dynamic thermal control and slightly improve performance.

It improves smoothness and removes some constraints to some extent, but at the cost of increased power consumption and heat (this module does not remove the thermal threshold, and when it reaches a certain threshold, the efficiency will decrease accordingly).


Tested on POCO F6 it works fine.  If it is another brand  You must experiment at your own risk.


Warning!! This module is high risk. You should research it carefully before using it. Do it at your own risk!!  Combination with other performance modules is not recommended.  Not responsible for anything at all

RealHard project This is just a beginner's experiment. If there is any mistake, I apologize. I accept all advice. Thank you.
